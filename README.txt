Inspiration
I wanted to make a more realistic ingot production line in a modpack so my goal was to force all ore production into Immersive Engineerings Blast/Arc Furnace. While this worked out ok, the blast furnace only has one input slot for processing, while many ores actually require many other inputs to process and modifiying things like taking charcoal out of the processing equation was not exatcly easy. 

This is a Minecraft mod that is centered around the following
   1. All Machines are Multiblocks
   2. Tech related to heavy industry(Coal Coke Production, Steel, Etc)
   3. All machines have easy to modify recipes. 

While there are several mods out there already doing this, they tend to be huge mods that add many other things that may not be wanted in a pack. I wanted to create a simple mod for modpack devs that may want infrastructure, but none of the other frills. 


Another important aspect for me is to try and make the multiblocks somewhat detailed, but to not look out of place in a Minecraft world.


Machines in Progress
- Honeycomb Coke Oven
   A simple to make coke oven that is supposed to be the first machine to be made in this mod
   Used to cook off impurities off of something like coal or refine logs into charcoal
- Future Planned Machines
  "Pre-Modern" Blast Furnace
     A simple blast furnace used to make ores into ingots. This will only be able to run off of solid fuel and depending on the ore, require a catalyst recipe added as well. The output is a molten version of the ore.
- "Modern" Coke Oven
     A faster version of the previous coke oven
- "Modern" Blast Furnace
     A faster version of the previous blast furance. THis will be able to run off of another mods Forge Energy generation. The output is a molten version of the ore.
- Some sort of way to compress air and apply it to machines
- A casting machine to convert fluid into ingots/plate/gears

Current Development is being tracked through Github Issues.
